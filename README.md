## Introduction

This data set contains the number of website visits generated on a Business to Business (B2B) corporate website as well as purchases made by date. As a B2B company, the clients are organizations, not individual customers and the purchase has substantial associated cost.

## The data

The dataset is avaiable here as [ts_data.csv](https://miles-become-a-data-scientist.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/J2/M7/ts_data.csv).

## Installation
